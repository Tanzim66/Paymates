### Tech Stack:

### Top 5 Technical Challenges:

1) Integrating Stripe API and payments securely into our application
2) Architecure of overall application as in, designing GraphQl models, authorizing mutations, defining public & private queries. The overall architecture can make or break this project, since careless decisions early in the development process can become costly later on.
3) Deployment of application either using Docker or purely through Heroku, can be difficult to deploy if backend and frontend are separate along with other containers possibly
4) Building canvas like frontend view and integrating it with the API to fetch/create posts and other backend actions tied closely with the frontend
5) Full integration of our tech stack into our application, we plan to use AWS S3 for image/file storage which can become difficult if integration isn't easily doable.
