### Description of Application:

The purpose of this application is to give roommates an easy and effective way to log household costs and split them up between each other as well. Users will be able to login to our application and create groups for their roommates to join. They can then simply create notes on the home page, or log costs and choose which roommates to include in the cost. There will also be a payment integration so users can directly clear their debts to their roommates through the application. 


Additional features are described below, but this is the main gist and purpose of our application.
